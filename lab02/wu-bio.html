    <h1>Alison's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    I am Alison Wu from <strong>Taiwan</strong>.<br>I am a sophomore majoring in information management and technology, where I am interested in being a <strong>project manager in Japan</strong> in the future. 
    <br>I don't really have prior experiences or skills in information studies, however, I am a music industry and music performance minor in which I have been playing the flute for more than 10 years. I've participated in lots of competition such as national Taiwanese music competition in 2022. 
    <br>Outside of school, I enjoy joining activities such as 
    <ul>
        <li>Taiwanese Association</li>
        <li>Japanese Association</li>
        <li>Badminton club</li>
        <li>Campus Connect</li>
        <li>CuseCrew</li>
    </ul>
    I have been self-studying japanese since high school, and I wish to go to Japan after I graduate. <br>A fun thing about me is that I am really afraid of cold, so my mood gets bad easily when I am in Syracuse. I love 100F weather!
