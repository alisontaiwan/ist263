    I am Alison Wu from Taiwan. I am a sophomore majoring in information management and technology, where I am interested in being a project manager in Japan in the future. I don't really have prior experiences or skills in information studies, however, I am a music industry and music performance minor in which I have been playing the flute for more than 10 years. I've participated in lots of competition such as national Taiwanese music competition in 2022. Outside of school, I enjoy joining activities such as Taiwanese Association and badminton club. I have been self-studying japanese since high school, and I wish to go to Japan after I graduate. A fun thing about me is that I am really afraid of cold, so my mood gets bad easily when I am in Syracuse. I love 100F weather!
