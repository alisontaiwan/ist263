          <p class="hook">Have you heard of an island in Asia called Taiwan, or probably Formosa? When Portuguese sailors came to Taiwan in 1542, they were shocked how gorgeous this island is, they then noted it on their map as llha Formosa (Portuguese for "beautiful island"). This island is where I call home. The size of this tiny island is 1/4 of New York State, however, surprisingly, Taiwan has 4 million more people compare to the whole New York state! Isn't it crazy? Okay, now, keep reading, and I will give you more introduction and facts about Taiwan. After reading, I know you are going to Taiwan as your next travel destination, so add it to your list before it's too late!</p>
